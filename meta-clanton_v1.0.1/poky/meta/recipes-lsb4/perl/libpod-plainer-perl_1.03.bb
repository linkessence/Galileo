SUMMARY = "Perl extension for converting Pod to old-style Pod."
DESCRIPTION = "Pod::Plainer uses Pod::Parser which takes Pod with the (new) 'C<< .. >>' \
constructs and returns the old(er) style with just 'C<>'; '<' and '>' are replaced by \
'E<lt>' and 'E<gt>'. \
\
This can be used to pre-process Pod before using tools which do not recognise the new style Pods."
