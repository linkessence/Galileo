I was seeing various issues with parallel make, mainly due to to what was likely 
partially installed headers. If you change into the source directory and
"NOISY=1 make  ../obj/apt-pkg/sourcelist.opic" in apt-pkg, you'll see it 
doesn't have any dependencies on the headers being installed. This patch
fixes that so things build correctly.
