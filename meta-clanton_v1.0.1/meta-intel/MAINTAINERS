This file contains a list of BSP maintainers for the BSPs contained in
the meta-intel repository.

Please submit any patches against meta-intel BSPs to the meta-intel
mailing list (meta-intel@yoctoproject.org).  Also, if your patches are
available via a public git repository, please also include a URL to
the repo and branch containing your patches as that makes it easier
for maintainers to grab and test your patches.

If you have problems with or questions about a particular BSP, feel
free to contact the maintainer directly (cc:ing the Yocto mailing list
puts it in the archive and helps other people who might have the same
questions in the future), but please try to do the following first:

  - look in the Yocto Project Bugzilla
    (http://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/) to see if a problem has
    already been reported

  - look through recent entries of the meta-intel
    (https://lists.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/meta-intel/) and Yocto
    (https://lists.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/yocto/) mailing list
    archives to see if other people have run into similar problems or
    had similar questions answered.

Descriptions of section entries:

	M: Mail patches to: FullName <address@domain>
	F: Files and directories with wildcard patterns.
	   A trailing slash includes all files and subdirectory files.
	   F:	meta-crownbay/	all files in and below meta-crownbay
	   F:	meta-crownbay/*	all files in meta-crownbay, but not below
	   One pattern per line.  Multiple F: lines acceptable.

Please keep this list in alphabetical order.
