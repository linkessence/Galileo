Poky Laverne Release 4.0

DEPENDENCIES
============

This layer depends on:

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake
  branch: master

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
  layers: meta
  branch: master

  URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-intel
  layers: intel
  branch: master

  URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
  layers: meta-yocto
  branch: master

NOTE: n450 currently depends on meta-yocto due to atom-pc
dependencies.  The plan is to move atom-pc to meta-intel as soon as
the layer tooling comes online and meta-yocto becomes its own
repository.  At that point, meta-yocto will no longer be required.

Note also that the layering with respect to the poky repository is in
transition; it currently contains both meta from openembedded-core and
bitbake along with some other files and directories which will
eventually be contained in standalone repositories once the ongoing
layering work has been completed.  As such, the master branch of the
poky repository can at the present time be used to satisfy all
meta-intel dependencies.

KNOWN ISSUES
============

See bugzilla.yoctoproject.org

382 - oprofile-server on PPC is built big-endian while oprofile-viewer 
      on host system may built with little-endian, but oprofile-server
      and oprofile-viewer are not implemented to correctly handle
      conversion between host byte order and network byte order, so
      oprofile-server and oprofile-viewer may run into connection issue.

439 - No audio from the Blacksand board Front Channel auido jack.
      Workaround: run the following cmd: 'amixer sset "Front" 30 on'

467 - Issues building with Fedora 14, this distribution provided a version
      of make that is not compatible with the Poky build system, the
      workaround it to build a native version of make via the build system.
      Users of Fedora 14 will need to do a 'bitbake make-native' before
      running any other targets.

429 - Building poky from scratch with /opt/poky in your path cause host
      contamination issues, be sure that /opt/poky is not in your path
      if building from scratch

160 - The Emenlow Hardware gets stuck in the HW Reboot sequence and needs
      to be power cycled.

Zypper / RPM Issues
489/490/491 - Due to some archetectual difference between Zypper and RPM5.0,
      there are some compatibility issues that prevent zypper from
      working correctly. 
      Packages can still be managed with the rpm commands.
