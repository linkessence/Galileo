/**
  A developer supplied function to perform platform specific operations.

  It's a developer supplied function to perform any operations appropriate to a
  given platform. It's invoked just before passing control to PEI core by SEC
  core. Platform developer may modify the SecCoreData passed to PEI Core.
  It returns a platform specific PPI list that platform wishes to pass to PEI core.
  The Generic SEC core module will merge this list to join the final list passed to
  PEI core.

  @param  SecCoreData           The same parameter as passing to PEI core. It
                                could be overridden by this function.

  @return The platform specific PPI list to be passed to PEI core or
          NULL if there is no need of such platform specific PPI list.
