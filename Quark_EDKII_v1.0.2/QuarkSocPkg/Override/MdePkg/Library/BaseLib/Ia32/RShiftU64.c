/**
  Shifts a 64-bit integer right between 0 and 63 bits. This high bits
  are filled with zeros. The shifted value is returned.

  This function shifts the 64-bit value Operand to the right by Count bits. The
  high Count bits are set to zero. The shifted value is returned.

  @param  Operand The 64-bit operand to shift right.
  @param  Count   The number of bits to shift right.

  @return Operand >> Count
